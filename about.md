Hello, I am Gian Carlo I. Gilos an aspiring software developer engrossed in learning all things software.

Following through what most Top tier software developers have I also created a blog.

This blog serves as a repository of the things that I'm learning right now, the problems I'm solving, the problems that I have yet to tackle, 
what I did to build something, and documentations from my personal wiki on environment setups (especially networking and IOT).

In the future this will become my *personal portfolio*.

If you want to email me on something: gianCarlo.gilos@outlook.com
